IDEA BANK

- creating a channel for a show or movie should automatically add it to 
  favorite_show or favorite_movie for the user... 
  maybe also joining a channel does the same?

- channel creator topic placeholder: Optional, will default to Movie or Show name
  and code that in

- get list of channels user is active in: user.active_channels

- get all channel messages: message where channel._id === targetChannel
    { label: "channel_0037", content: { text, author, ipaddress} }
    socket.listen("channel_02")
    socket.listen("channel_007")

- reveal chat history by episode watched, filter by Date
    history scope by current season 

- show explorer (
  show anonymous user reviews of shows
)

channels when muted show number of messages in hidden history 

trending section: shows most popular in each genre

friend comparison: can compare ratings of content you've both seen and get a percentage compatibility match

make daily server calls to get api data and populate tries with movie and show titles

user time zone vs official air date and time

Merging Oath and Socket:
  - does middleware run in mongoose.connect?
  - do we require user login verification in socket connection?
  - does socket maintain live connection through routes?

COOKIES

  require "cookie-parser"   // server file
  app.use(cookieParser(process.env.SECRET))   // server file
  res.cookie("name", object, cookieOptions)   // clients-side
  cookieOptions = {
    httpOnly: true,
    signed: true,
    maxAge: (1000 * 60) ^ 60,
    expiresIn: new Date(Date.now() + 90000)
  }


// Notes
// Mixed types and dates that are modified using JavaScript Date methods 
// are not hooked into mongoose change tracking logic. 
// To save changes, let mongoose know about them using markModified('path') 
// before calling save.

Allowed schema paths
• String - Any string, UTF-8 encoded
• Number - default support is enough for most cases
• Date - Typically returned from MongoDB as an ISODate
object
• Boolean - True or false
• Buffer - For binary information such as images
• Mixed - Any data type
• Array - Can either be an array of the same data type, or
an array of nested sub-documents
• ObjectId - For a unique ID in a path other than _id;
typically used to reference _id paths in other documents 


If you have Board embedded in Surf, you can update using something like Surf.update({ 'board._id': board._id }, { $set: { board: board.toObject() } }, { multi: true }, callback);
